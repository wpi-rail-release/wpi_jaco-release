ros-indigo-jaco-description (0.0.16-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * copied old meshes. manual texturing failed on web.
  * Minor fixes for better placement of items.
    Also:
    - Actually launches joint controllers in the Gazebo launch
    - Allows the robot to be specified, this allows mounting the Jaco arm on
    a variety of bases using the same gazebo launch.
  * Added Gazebo support.
    Added necessary elements for Gazebo simulation:
    - Mass (currently made up)
    - Inertia (currently made up)
    - Joint controllers for the Gazebo robot using ROS Control
    - Transmissions on necessary joints
    - Gripper tag to support grasping (may need tuning)
